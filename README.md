# make your own macOS apps

NOTE: you might need to Allow Audio and Video in the Autoplay settings in your browser's address bar!

NOTE: FireFox has a bug where it won't trigger video autoplay with page transitions, use Chrome unfortunately :(

## To make this slide app your own

- Update the settings in `src/meta/settings.json`
- Create the slide mdx in `src/content/slides/`
- Create videos in `public/videos`
- Create images in `src/assets/images/`
- Add voice overs to `public/voice-over`
- Replace the logo svg in `src/assets/images/logo.svg`

## Script for elevenlabs.io voice overs

At blackspike design we often create single-use mac apps for automating repetitive tasks, like this app, to generate web-ready videos.

AI is excellent at AppleScript, so prompt it for f f m-peg commands to optimise and convert dragged mp4's to web-m, and extract the first frame as an avif poster image.

Paste the code into your Mac's built-in Script Editor app in your Utilities folder, and save it with the file format set to Application.

Now drag any mp4 file onto the app for a collection of web-ready videos. As a bonus, we copy an html video tag snippet to your clipboard, ready to paste into a web page.

Finally, we use a custom icon we drew in Inkscape â€“ a different colour for each app. Download ours from the video description.

We use #AI to write single-use #AppleScript mac applications to save time on routine web development tasks.

For example: a drag-and-drop #macOS App to optimise and encode web ready videos.
