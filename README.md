# Make custom macOS apps: creating our own web development tools

## Recording

Set your screen recording view to 960px x 540px (we use [cleanshot.com](https://cleanshot.com))

NOTE: you might need to Allow Audio and Video in the Autoplay settings in your browser's address bar

NOTE: FireFox has a bug where it won't trigger video autoplay with page transitions, use Chrome unfortunately :(

We use #AI to write single-use #AppleScript macOS applications to automate routine web development tasks. In this example: a drag-and-drop app to encode website-ready video to optimised mp4, webm, and avif.

## Script

At blackspike design we often create single-use mac apps for automating repetitive tasks, like this app, to generate web-ready videos.

AI is excellent at AppleScript, so prompt it for ffmpeg commands to optimise and convert dragged mp4's to webm, and extract the first frame as an avif poster image.

Paste the code into your Mac's built-in Script Editor app in your Utilities folder, and save it with the file format set to Application.

Now drag any mp4 file onto the app for a collection of web-ready videos. As a bonus, we copy an html video tag snippet to your clipboard, ready to paste into a web page.

Finally, we use a custom icon we drew in Inkscape â€“ a different colour for each app. Download ours from the video description.
